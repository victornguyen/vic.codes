For reasons I won't get into here, I was unable to work (or do anything) for an
18 month period spanning 2017 to 2018. I was completely off the grid.

When things returned to normal in 2019, I found myself in the unique position
of rejoining an industry that had grown by 18 months while having zero
knowledge of what had transpired. I was like Captain America waking up after
being frozen for 70 years...

... but better looking.

After much anxiety about resuming my professional career, I dove into some
contract work and found that getting up to speed after a long period of
inactivity wasn't as difficult as I'd expected. In fact, some of the more
tricky challenges were ones I wasn't anticipating.

Here's what I learnt:

## Teamwork. So helpful ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›

My 2018 was fairly isolated, so rejoining the workforce and suddenly being
surrounded by all manner of people was a shock to the system.

Navigating the sea of personalities, roles and agendas, while trying to earn
the respect of teammates inside a team with an established dynamic proved to be
the most challenging -- but fulfilling -- part of my return.

Going in I was so worried about keeping up with my code, but that turned out to
be the easy part. It was the process of re-learning the value of effective
communication in a multi-discipline team (and how to do it well) that demanded
most of my attention.

Focussing on building relationships within a team can help pave the path you
need to walk, but you also end up just making great friends along the way.
It's a win-win.

## Self-doubt. So helpful ðŸ’­

As far as I know, there are only two rules for maintaining a blog as a developer:

1. âœ… Your blog must be hilariously over-engineered
2. âœ… You must write about Imposter Syndrome

Of all the hot takes on Imposter Syndrome I've read, I like [Rach
Smith's](https://rachsmith.com/2017/i-dont-have-imposter-syndrome/) the most.

Even with that in mind, I was still carrying around a chunk of self-doubt
wherever I went. Keys, wallet, phone, self-doubt.

However, over time, I've come to embrace it. It helps me maintain an
edge I otherwise wouldn't have. It allows me to self-identify as a beginner
again, which has made me more open and ready to learn.

## Not _that_ much changes

Even though I was now worthy enough to wield the power of self-doubt...

... I found that there was nowhere near as much to catch-up on as I thought
there would be.

In the real world, building real products, with real money at stake, technology
simply just doesn't move at the pace our Twitter feeds would have us believe.

Changes are usually iterative. Evolutionary rather than revolutionary, building
on ideas that were built on ideas previous to those, and so on.

So even after 18 months, I wasn't completely lost because I could see the
through-line from 2017 and 2019. Here are some notes I took in my first week
back:

```markdown {8}
## Things to catchup on
* React: HoCs > render props > hooks (which look like mixins that can
  access state?)
* React: context has an actual API now. Check it out.
* Everyone seems to use VSCode now. Check it out. Is it good?
* Relearn your git commands and aliases. Create new aliases that make
  sense to 2019-you.
* You'll be right.
```

## Prettier. So helpful ðŸ§¹

My initial reaction upon seeing [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) in action was
a visceral, _"I don't like it."_ I didn't like the idea of something doing that
much for me.

20 seconds later, I completely changed my tone.

Seriously, I just vomit code into my editor now with no regard for spacing or
formatting and Prettier obediently tidies it up instantly. It's like I've freed
up a CPU core in my brain that was previously dedicated to formatting. It feels
like cheating.

## TypeScript. So... helpful?

This was a suprising one to me. Before my sabbatical, the last time I'd used
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) was in an enterprise Angular 1.x
app for a big bank. It had the repuation of being overbearing with a poor ROI,
while [Flow](https://flow.org/) seemed have have the backing of the community.

One extended period of time later, that's flipped on it's head.

It makes sense. As web technologies are asked to do more and more, the
legitimisation of the web as a platform continues, the idea of TypeScript and
its benefits scales well with the increasing complexity of our frontends.

Although there already seems to be some [healthy
discussion](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-typescript-tax-132ff4cb175b)
about whether the investment is worth it.

## Programming is still fun

More than anything, I rediscovered just how _fun_ it all was.

I will always view programming as a team sport. Like real team sports, it was
the small "in-between" moments between teammates I relished the most. Like the
excitement when you and a teammate discover you can both mutually benefit from
a refactor of a common set of logic. _"We're the best! Everyone wins!"_ Or when
you and your pair both realise you'd both held the same dumb assumption for
hours when approaching a problem.  _"We're the worst! We're so stupid!"_

At the same time, programming is also a rewarding solo experience. Where it's
just you, the problem and an afternoon to solve it. I love those moments too.

Err... so what I'm really trying to say is, I'm the Captain America of frontend
development.
